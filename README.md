Sometimes you get a metadata export from a system like AEM, which has a generic field for Tags that may contain a bunch of different key:value pairs in a single cell. For example the data in one particular cell might look something like: industry:healthcare,industry:laboratory,audience:corporate,audience:all,topic:science,topic:math, etc. etc. Say you only want the audience values - this is the script for you.
